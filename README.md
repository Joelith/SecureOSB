SecureOSB
=========

This is a demonstration of accessing data secured in the Oracle Database with Label Security via Oracle Service Bus. The benefit of this approach is that the security of the data is managed by the Database and the Service Bus implementation is much simpler. 
To run this workshop, you'll need to install and configure Labal Security in an Oracle Database (Enterprise Edition). For instructions on how to do this see my blog post: http://ofmcanberra.wordpress.com/2014/10/22/oracle-label-security-part-1-intro/. I'll also put up a post on how to get this project working on the blog shortly
